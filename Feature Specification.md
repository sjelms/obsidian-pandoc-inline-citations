# Feature Specification: Aliased Citation Handling

**Feature Branch**: [implementation-aliased-citations](https://github.com/sjelms/obsidian-pandoc-inline-citations/tree/implementation-aliased-citations)  
**Created**: 2025-09-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Ensure the plugin renders standard citations with Pandoc-style output but skips aliased citations so Obsidian handles them natively."

---

## Execution Flow (main)
```markdown
1. Parse user description from Input
   â†’ Success: clear request to differentiate aliased vs non-aliased citations
2. Extract key concepts from description
   â†’ Actors: Obsidian user, plugin
   â†’ Actions: render citation links, bypass alias links
   â†’ Data: citation keys, alias text
   â†’ Constraints: alias always indicated by `|`
3. Clarify unclear aspects
   â†’ Citation keys are always formatted in the specified way and generated from BibTeX.
   â†’ Aliased citations should always bypass Pandoc, even if alias is short (e.g., "ibid.").
4. User Scenarios & Testing section: defined below
5. Functional Requirements: testable items listed
6. Entities: citation key, alias, reference cache
7. Review Checklist: some clarifications remain
```

## âš¡ Quick Guidelines
- âœ… Focused on user needs (clean, legible rendering of citations)
- âœ… Avoids HOW (no code or regex in this section)
- ðŸ‘¥ Written for plugin stakeholders (users, maintainers)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a researcher writing in Obsidian,  
I want standard citations to render as Pandoc-formatted references,  
and aliased citations to render using Obsidianâ€™s native alias handling,  
so that my notes remain clean, legible, and consistent.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a note with `[[@Klein2022-xj]]`,  
   **When** the plugin renders it,  
   **Then** it should appear as `(Klein 2022)` in reading/preview mode.  

2. **Given** a note with `[[@Klein2022-xj|Why Housing Is So Expensive]]`,  
   **When** the plugin encounters it,  
   **Then** it should **not process the link** and allow Obsidianâ€™s native renderer to display the alias as `Why Housing Is So Expensive`.  

### Edge Cases
- Citation keys are always formatted in the specified way and generated from BibTeX.  
- Malformed links should not occur, but if they do, it is helpful for debugging purposes.  
- Obsidian does not support nested or multiple aliases and it is not required to support them.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST render non-aliased citations (`[[@citekey]]`) as Pandoc-style references (Author Year).  
- **FR-002**: System MUST ignore aliased citations (`[[@citekey|Alias]]`) and allow Obsidianâ€™s renderer to display the alias text.  
- **FR-003**: System MUST NOT corrupt or alter the alias text provided by the user.  
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle malformed citation links gracefully (e.g., log or ignore, without breaking rendering).  
- **FR-005**: System SHOULD support citekeys containing hyphens; citekeys never contain underscores or colons.  

### Key Entities
- **Citation Key**: Identifier beginning with `@`, used to match against bibliography cache.  
- **Alias Text**: User-specified display text after a `|` in Obsidian links.  
- **Reference Cache**: Pluginâ€™s store of citation metadata (used for Pandoc rendering).
